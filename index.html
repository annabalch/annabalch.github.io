	<h2>Which two websites are you most inspired by?</h2>

		<p>I'm most inspired by where I work, <a href="http://www.qz.com" target="_blank">Quartz</a>, as well as <a href="http://www.makehook.co/" target="_blank">Makehook</a>.</p>

	<h2>How do they exhibit effective use of space, size or balance?</h2>

		<p>I have a little more insight into Quartz's design since I work there but I love how Quartz uses positive and negative space to direct the user through their experience while on site. For example, on qz.com's homepage the first thing one sees is a huge header image for our top story. There aren't any other visuals on the page competing with the negative space which entices the reader to click on the top story. As the user scrolls down they are then brought into the rest of the content. What I like about Makehook is their use of looping video as the first thing the user sees. I also like that as you scroll through the homepage, the navigational buttons at the top stay static which is a nice balance.</p>

	<h2>What makes them similar and different?</h2>

		<p>What makes Quartz and Makehook similar is the minimalist approach to the design aesthetic. The balance is the same as it focuses on a fluid user experience and infinite scroll. What makes them different is where Quartz hides the site navigation, Makehook keeps it at the forefront of the user experience.</p>

	<h2>Thumbnail Sketches</h2>

		<p>The below are sketches for what I hope to be a minimalist web design site showcasing my services and work.</p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Homepage</strong></li>
			<p>The homepage represents my compnay logo at the top left, a nav bar at the top that is clean and always present as the user navigates, with a large header image followed by white negative space with simple text followed by another image.</p>

			<p>The bottom of the homepage will continue with the same clean lines and negative space with minimal positive space.</p>

		<li><strong>About</strong></li>	
			<p>The About page will feature the same nav at the top with an image of me and text about me along with image boxes below to link out to either my instagram feed or what I'm currently interested in on the web.</p>

		<li><strong>Portfolio</strong></li>
			<p>The Portfolio page will have boxes of the logos of sites I've designed.</p>

		<li><strong>Services</strong></li>
			<p>This page will be clean lines of text outlining my services. White background and different sizes of font to show hierarchy.</p>

		<li><strong>Contact</strong></li>
			<p>The contact page will have a lead-gen form inside where those who are interested can connect with me. Having an all white background focuses the user on the text.</p>
